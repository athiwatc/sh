<h1>Visualization</h1>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<ol>
<li>Install Meteor Framework using <code>curl install.meteor.com | sh</code> or go and compile it yourself <code>https://github.com/meteor/meteor</code>.</li>
<li>Download NodeJS if you have not already.</li>
<li>run <code>sudo npm -g install meteorite</code>.</li>
<li>Clone or Download a copy of the source code.</li>
<li>Change to the downloaded source code and execute <code>mrt</code>.</li>
<li>Visit <code>http://localhost:3000</code> to get the website running.</li>
</ol>


<h2>Generating data files</h2>

<p>There are two ways that data have to be generated. Note that the example after you have clone should work correctly.</p>

<h3>First is the standard data</h3>

<p>This is where you convert your data set into the standard data set by using the language of your choice. Please take a look at <code>public/sample-data.txt</code> and <code>public/all-pos.txt</code></p>

<h3>Second part is automatic</h3>

<p>If you want to add more visualization graph, please look at the client folder and <code>router.js</code> and <code>router.coffee</code>. The convertor is at <code>server/convertor_tools.coffee</code>. Please write everything into <code>public</code> folder because the web application can we access by the URL from the root. eg. <code>http://localhost:3000/my-img.png</code> will be put in <code>public/my-img.png</code></p>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<ol>
<li>Even this application works looks like a normal web application but it works like a normal desktop application where not everything can be done in the browser and the browser is mostly used for displaying information only.</li>
<li>There is a mix of javascript and coffeescript as we prefer different language type. Which is not really a big problem into end.</li>
</ol>
